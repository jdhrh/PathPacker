Overview
========

This is a simple utility, with the intention of reading from a packed
payload, into a searchable tree.

The tree is comprised of url path bases.

Also, to be able to take a list of these path bases, and render a packed payload.


Algorithm
=========

For more information on the algorith used to pack the payload, see

Compiling
=========

You can use either ant, or maven. I included the only two jar deps, for local 
tools and ant builds.
But the unit tests are currently run with maven.
